<p>Unfortunately, unforeseen circumstances arose at my current job that required my immediate attention and resulted in a significant workload, so I was unable to complete the full assignment within the initial timeframe. 
However, I have attached the partial version that I was able to put together in <strong>1 day (today)</strong>. 
I believe it provides a glimpse of my approach and coding style, despite its incompleteness. <br> The most complete service is products-service. I didn't have time to write tests. My plan was to add API gateway, Resilience 4J, Zipkin, Micrometer Metrics with Grafana, Prometheus and include all of these in a docker-compose. Also, write unit and integration tests & use test containers.  

If you would be open to it, I am more than willing to participate in a technical interview where I can further discuss my thought process and approach to the task, as I'm sure I'll be able to make a stronger impression that way.<p>
